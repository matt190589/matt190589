- 👋 Hi, I’m @matt190589 or Matt when I'm not on Github :)
- 👀 I’m a full stack developer with experience and I began my coding journey about 6 months ago. My previous experience has been largely based in international education and education management. I'm an experienced Project Manager and have entered Tech to combine coding with entrepreneurial opportunities.
- 🌱 As a recent Bootcamp graduate, I've done self-directed learning in HTML, CSS & Python but my skills have developed over the past few months in Javascript, Nodejs, React, PostgresSQL  and Nextjs. 
- I'm keen and very enthusiastic about building my skills in these areas but also in databases, servers and real-world projects.
